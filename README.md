# **Johnny's Arcade**

_This is a video game-based app with challenges and user interaction, similar to a virtual arcade room where the focus isn't just on the game itself, but also on competing and challenging other players. The purpose is to entertain and provide users with incentives to keep playing, such as trophies and clan interactions, allowing them to share and compete with others._

The project consists of four main folders and some files necessary for the correct functioning of the project:

## **arcade_api**
This folder contains most of the Django project, including Django-related folders and files like migrations and the `__init__.py` file, as well as custom files I created, such as:

- **admin.py**: Registers every model to access them from the Django admin panel, allowing for easy access, creation, and modification of database elements.

- **models.py**: Contains several models, both individual and related to each other, for every database element required for the correct functioning of the app, such as user interactions and app-specific data.

- **serializers.py**: Since Iâ€™m using DRF (Django Rest Framework), this file contains serializers that validate and transform data from Django models into JSON format for sending, reading, receiving, and saving data to the main database.

- **urls.py**: Registers every URL associated with a Django view, generating the API endpoints for every function related to the database and allowing frontend access to the database data.

- **views.py**: Manages HTTP requests, defining how data is retrieved or processed, handling permissions, and linking models with each view to ensure appropriate data access and manipulation.

## **arcade_front**
This folder contains the front end part of the project, including all the interfaze, the user experience and interaction with the DRF API, such as:

### API

- **api.js**:  This file utilizes the Axios library to manage HTTP requests, facilitating communication with the DRF back-end. It also handles headers and authorization for secure data transmission.
